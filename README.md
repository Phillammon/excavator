excavator
========

excavator is a `spadingScript` for the Kingdom of Loathing. It collects and stores data throughout your play into the `spadingData`, which will then be send via kmail to the player `Excavator` once you run the `spade` command in the CLI.

Probably relies on a very recent version of mafia.
